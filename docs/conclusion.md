# Conclusion
---

Results obtained from introducing a stacked autoencoder deep learning technique for P300 speller show a noticeable increase in classifying single trials over the PCA-based methods.

The work could be extended by usage of:
- Convolutional Neural Networks could be considered.
- Variational autoencoders and comparing its performance with the different stack size selections.
